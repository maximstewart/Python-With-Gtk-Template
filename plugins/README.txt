### Note
Copy the example and rename it to your desired name. Plugins define a ui target slot with the 'ui_target' requests data but don't have to if not directly interacted with.
Plugins must have a run method defined; though, you do not need to necessarily do anything within it. The run method implies that the passed in event system or other data is ready for the plugin to use.


### Manifest Example (All are required even if empty.)
```
class Manifest:
    name: str     = "Example Plugin"
    author: str   = "John Doe"
    version: str  = "0.0.1"
    support: str  = ""
    requests: {}  = {
        'pass_ui_objects': ["plugin_control_list"],
        'pass_events': "true",
        'bind_keys': []
    }
    pre_launch: bool = False
```


### Requests
```
requests: {}  = {
    'pass_events': "true",                                # If empty or not present will be ignored.
    "pass_ui_objects": [""],                              # Request reference to a UI component. Will be passed back as array to plugin.
    'bind_keys': [f"{name}||send_message:<Control>f"],
                  f"{name}||do_save:<Control>s"]          # Bind keys with method and key pare using list. Must pass "name" like shown with delimiter to its right.

}
```
